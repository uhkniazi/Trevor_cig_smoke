# Function: f_lGetPCAClusterCount
# Desc: Takes first two components of the PCA and counts possible clusters. The function does this by 
#       binning the vector of data into X bins, assigning a class label to each bin, counting how many
#       observations in each bin, any total number of bins with at least one observations. This is calculated
#       for both the components of the pca matrix, and the max number of bins with at least one observation, in
#       first or second dimension is reported along with a data.frame with cluster labels.
# Args: pr.out = principal component object returned by prcomp function
# Rets: returns list with 2 elements: 
#       1 - cluster.count = possible number of clusters in the data
#       2 - cluster.label = data.frame with cluster labels
f_lGetPCAClusterCount = function(pr.out){
  # how many clusters in data, using first 2 components
  x1 = pr.out$x[,1]
  x2 = pr.out$x[,2]
  # bin the data from the 2 components
  h1 = hist(x1, plot=F)
  # give a class label to each bin
  c1 = cut(x1, h1$breaks, labels = 1:(length(h1$mids)))
  h2 = hist(x2, plot=F)
  c2 = cut(x2, h2$breaks, labels = 1:(length(h2$mids)))
  # labels for vectors and the class labels
  dfClust = data.frame(lab=names(x1), c1, c2)
  # get contingency table
  mClust = as.matrix(table(c1 = dfClust$c1, c2 = dfClust$c2))
  # count the max of row and col sums that are not zero
